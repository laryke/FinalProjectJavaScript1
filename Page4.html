                <h5>Anatomy and appearance</h5>
                <p>
                    <img class="fit" src="/images/upper.JPG" align="right" title="Upper teeth" />

                    The great white shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin
                    are approximately the same size which is similar to some mackerel sharks.
                    A great white displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes
                    in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance.
                    The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's
                    outline when <img class="fit" src="/images/lower.JPG" align="right" title="Lower teeth" /> seen from
                    the side.
                    From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette
                    against the sunlight.
                    Leucism is extremely rare in this species, but has been documented in one great white shark (a pup
                    that washed ashore in Australia and died).
                    Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones, ready
                    to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the
                    teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.
                    Great white sharks, like other mackerel sharks, have larger eyes than other shark species in
                    proportion to their body size. The iris of the eye is a deep blue instead of black.
                </p>
                <h6>Size</h6>
                <p>
                    In great white sharks, sexual dimorphism is present, and females are generally larger than males.
                    Male great whites on average measure 3.4 to 4.0 m (11 to 13 ft) long, while females at 4.6 to 4.9 m
                    (15 to 16 ft).
                    Adults of this species weigh 522–771 kg (1,151–1,700lb) on average; however, mature females can have
                    an average mass of 680–1,110 kg (1,500–2,450lb).
                    The largest females have been verified up to 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and an estimated 1,905 kg
                    (4,200lb) in weight, perhaps up to 2,268 kg (5,000lb).

                    The largest great white recognized by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) is one caught
                    by Alf Dean in south Australian waters in 1959, weighing 1,208 kg (2,663lb).
                    Several larger great whites caught by anglers have since been verified, but were later disallowed
                    from formal recognition by IGFA monitors for rules violations.

                <h6>Bite force</h6>
                <p>
                    A 2007 study from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, used CT scans of a shark's
                    skull and computer models to measure the shark's maximum bite force.
                    The study reveals the forces and behaviors its skull is adapted to handle and resolves competing
                    theories about its feeding behavior. 
                    In 2008, a team of scientists led by Stephen Wroe conducted an experiment to determine the great
                    white shark's jaw power and findings indicated that a specimen massing 3,324 kg (7,328lb) could
                    exert a bite force of 18,216 newtons (4,095 lbf).

                <p id="3">

                        title="Shark off Guadalupe Island, Mexico" />
                    Great white sharks live in almost all coastal and offshore waters which have water temperature
                    between 12 and 24 °C (54 and 75 °F), with greater concentrations in the United
                    States (Northeast and California), South Africa, Japan, Oceania, Chile, and
                    the Mediterranean including Sea of Marmara and Bosphorus.
                    One of the densest-known populations is found around Dyer Island, South Africa.The great white is
                    an epipelagic fish, observed mostly in the presence of rich game, such as fur
                    seals (Arctocephalus ssp.), sea lions, cetaceans, other sharks, and large bony fish species.
                    In the open ocean, it has been recorded at depths as great as 1,200 m (3,900 ft). These findings
                    challenge the traditional notion that the great white is a coastal species.
                    A 2018 study indicated that white sharks prefer to congregate deep in anticyclonic eddies in
                    the North Atlantic Ocean. The sharks studied tended to favor the warm water eddies, spending the
                    daytime hours at 450 meters and coming to the surface at night.
